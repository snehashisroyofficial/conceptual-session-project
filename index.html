      <h2>List of birds of Brazil</h2>
      <p>
        Brazil has one of the richest bird diversities in the world. The
        avifauna of Brazil include a total of 1859 confirmed species of which
        238 are endemic. Five have been introduced by humans, 93 are rare or
        vagrants, and seven are known or thought to be extinct or extirpated. An
        additional 14 species are hypothetical (see below). Brazil hosts about
        60% of the bird species recorded for all of South America. These numbers
        are still increasing almost every year, due to new occurrences, new
        species being described, or splits of existing species. About 10% of the
        bird species found in Brazil are, nonetheless, threatened. In June 2013
        a simultaneous discovery of fifteen bird species in Brazil was
        announced, the first such since 1871, when August von Pelzeln described
        forty new species.[1] The birds were from the families Corvidae,
        Thamnophilidae, Dendrocolaptidae, Tyrannidae, and Polioptilidae.[2]
        Eleven of the new species are endemics of Brazil and four also inhabit
        Peru and Bolivia.[1]
